# Defender

Welcome to Defender, a remake of the game of the same name, written in Pascal.

This one was made while in high-school, in 1994. It was a collaboration with Alex Mazilu under the BlueFlower name, and it was one of the three games we've worked on together back then.

It is, unfortunately, unfinished and there are no plans to port it to Free Pascal and SDL at this time (or ever ;)

## Setup&Install&Build (original, DOS)
